This is a full-stack modern web chat application that allows people all over the world who are heartbroken or looking for love to chat anonymously. 
All messages in the chat application are submitted to Hedera where hashgraph will come to a consensus on a provable, fair order within the topic, with a sequence number, running hash, and consensus timestamp attached. Then the messages will be propagated through a Hedera Mirror Node before displaying to clients connected to the same topic.
